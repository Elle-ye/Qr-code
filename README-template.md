## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I struggled quite a bit with the positioning of the body.  The body was refusing to take up the 100% height I gave it. The bottom portion of screen was being taken up something I couldn't see.
I finally found the solution. Use view-width (vw) and view-height(vh) instead of percentage. The main content was still not centering properly tho (with margin: auto).
Figured out margin: auto only works for centering items horizontally. So I used flexbox for the vertical centering.




### Continued development

I definitely need to work on positioning of items. With focus on flexbox and grid.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.google.com) - I searched on Google to find the explanation for why margin: auto doesn't center items vertically.
